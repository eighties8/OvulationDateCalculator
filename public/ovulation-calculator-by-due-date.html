        <h1>Ovulation Calculator by Due Date</h1>
        
        <p>Our ovulation calculator by due date helps you determine your most fertile days based on your menstrual cycle. Whether you're trying to conceive or simply want to understand your fertility patterns, this tool provides accurate estimates for your ovulation window.</p>

        <h2>How the Ovulation Calculator by Due Date Works</h2>
        
        <p>The <strong>ovulation calculator by due date</strong> uses your last menstrual period (LMP) and average cycle length to predict when you'll ovulate. Here's how it works:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Input Your Data:</strong> Enter the first day of your last period and your typical cycle length</li>
            <li><strong>Calculate Ovulation:</strong> The calculator determines ovulation typically occurs 14 days before your next period</li>
            <li><strong>Identify Fertile Window:</strong> Your most fertile days are the 5-6 days leading up to ovulation plus the day of ovulation</li>
            <li><strong>Plan Accordingly:</strong> Use this information for conception planning or fertility awareness</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Understanding Your Fertile Window</h2>
        
        <p>Your fertile window is the time when you're most likely to conceive. The <strong>ovulation calculator by due date</strong> helps you identify this critical period:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pre-Ovulation Days:</strong> Sperm can survive in the female reproductive tract for up to 5 days</li>
            <li><strong>Ovulation Day:</strong> The egg is released and viable for about 12-24 hours</li>
            <li><strong>Post-Ovulation:</strong> The egg disintegrates if not fertilized within 24 hours</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For example, if you have a 28-day cycle and your last period started on January 1st, you would likely ovulate around January 15th. Your fertile window would be approximately January 10th-15th.</p>

        <h2>Factors That Affect Ovulation Timing</h2>
        
        <p>While our <strong>ovulation calculator by due date</strong> provides reliable estimates, several factors can influence your actual ovulation timing:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cycle Length:</strong> Women with irregular cycles may ovulate at different times</li>
            <li><strong>Stress Levels:</strong> High stress can delay or prevent ovulation</li>
            <li><strong>Hormonal Changes:</strong> Conditions like PCOS can affect ovulation patterns</li>
            <li><strong>Age:</strong> Ovulation patterns may change as you age</li>
            <li><strong>Lifestyle Factors:</strong> Diet, exercise, and sleep can impact fertility</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Our advanced <strong>ovulation calculator by due date</strong> accounts for individual cycle variations and provides personalized results. Whether you're actively trying to conceive or simply want to understand your body better, this tool offers valuable insights into your fertility patterns.</p>
